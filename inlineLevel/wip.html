      <h3>Properties of inline elements</h3>
      <blockquote>
        Do not start on a new line.
        Only use as much horizontal space as required by the content.
        Do not accept width and height CSS properties.
        Margins will work horizontally, but not vertically.
        Padding works on all sides, but the top and bottom may overlap other elements.
